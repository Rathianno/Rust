# Overview
Hello! I have been studying rust, I'm just storing this here, it's just a simple calculator, I played around with it a lot but this is just a small demo thing.

Rust is an awesome language, I can see it being really useful for back-end stuff as something else to use aside from C++ and those faster simpler languages. I should learn more of it

# Development Environment

Just used Rust in VSC.

# Useful Websites
